# Code Commit

## What's Code Commit?
A Front-end development cum designing event where participants get a basic template and they apply their own practical designing and styling skills to enhance it by their own innovative and awesome ideas.

```N.B. - No Libraries/Framework allowed for styling(Only HTML/CSS/JS).```



## Instructions

You will be having a branch of your name in the original repository under which you need to raise a PR(Pull Request).

### Prerequisites
* Github Account
* Git
* Code Editor(Preferably VS Code)

### Follow the below steps to start working on the code: 

* Fork the ``Code Commit`` repository to your Github(After which, you'll see the same in your list of repositories).

* Clone the repository to your PC using command ```git clone <Your Forked Repository Link>```

* Start working on the template on your **branch only** and make sure you add commits at intermediate steps to keep track of your changes.

* After you have finished working, Set up the upstream branch to push your local code to your forked repository using ```git push -u origin <Your branch name>```

* Having pushed the final code, raise a   ``Pull Request`` to the original repository and make sure both branches should match with your name only.
